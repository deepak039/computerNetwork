## What is the Internet Made Of?

- **Computers connected by links.**
- Multiple links terminate at a switch/router. Switches and routers connect a set of computers to one another.
- Many switches/routers in an organization like IITB connect all the end hosts.
- **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** connect multiple end-user organizations.
- ISP networks have several routers that provide interconnections and form the **"backbone"** of the Internet.
- Some end hosts also provide useful services and applications (e.g., web and mail servers). So the Internet is mainly **end hosts** and **routers**.

### IP Addresses
- Every machine on the Internet has a unique address called the **IP address**.
- IP addresses are assigned **statically** or **dynamically** (e.g., DHCP). They can be **public** or **private** (like in IITB).

## What Happens When You Open a Web Page?
1. **URL Resolution:** The URL is resolved into the IP address of the web server via DNS.
2. **TCP Connection:** The browser opens a TCP connection to the web server and sends a GET request for the web page.
3. **Server Response:** The server sends some HTML content, which the browser displays.
4. **Additional Requests:** The browser may send multiple GET requests for images and other objects, possibly opening multiple TCP connections.
5. **Routing:** TCP data is routed through several routers from the client's IP to the server's IP.
6. **Final Step:** The IP router next to the web server hands the packet to the server via LAN.
7. **Communication Continues:** Several TCP segments and acknowledgments are exchanged until the full web page is transferred.

## Concept of Layering

- **Layering**: Each layer in the networking stack handles specific functions, communicating with its "peer" layer at the other end using predefined protocols.
- Layers provide **abstraction** or **services** to the layers above them.
- Example: The **application layer** at the client sends a GET request, and the application layer at the server responds with the requested page.

### Key Layers (5 Layers System):
1. **Application Layer**
2. **Transport Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Link Layer**
5. **Physical Layer**

## Encapsulation and Decapsulation

- Each layer adds **headers** to the data from the layer above it. These headers assist in the layerâ€™s operations and are removed by the peer layer at the other end.

## Overview of Layers

### Application Layer
- Focuses on **application-level semantics**.
- Example: A browser issues GET requests and displays results, while the web server holds pages and serves them.
- **Popular Protocols:** HTTP, SMTP, P2P protocols.

### Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Handles the transfer of application data, ensuring reliability and proper order.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides a simpler, unreliable transport.
- **Key Responsibilities:** Segmentation, flow control, congestion control, retransmission.

### Network Layer (IP Layer)
- **IP Datagrams:** Responsible for routing datagrams to their destination IP addresses.
- **Routing:** Routers use **forwarding tables** to decide the next hop for each datagram.

### Routing Protocols
- **Intradomain Routing:** E.g., OSPF within an organization for shortest path routing.
- **Interdomain Routing (BGP):** Connects different organizations and handles routing policies.

### Link Layer
- **Link Layer Frames:** Deals with local delivery of packets over a LAN, converting IP addresses to MAC addresses using ARP and transmitting data over the LAN.

### Physical Layer
- Transmits actual bits over physical media like copper wires, optical fibers, or wireless radio.

## Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching

- **Circuit Switching:** Reserves resources along the entire path of data flow, ensuring a dedicated circuit. Used in traditional telephone networks.
- **Packet Switching:** Data is broken into packets and forwarded through intermediate nodes using **store-and-forward** techniques. Internet networks use packet switching.

## Statistical Multiplexing vs Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)

- **TDM:** Resources are shared by allocating timeslots, which can result in resource wastage.
- **Statistical Multiplexing:** Resources are shared dynamically, providing better utilization but without guaranteed service quality.

### Problem Example: Multiplexing in Networking
- With statistical multiplexing, more users can be supported compared to TDM, but queuing and delays may occur during peak usage.

## History of Networking

- **1960s:** Concept of packet switching emerged.
- **1970s:** Proprietary networks like ARPANET developed, leading to the creation of top-level store-and-forward gateways and the primitive TCP/IP protocols.
- **1980s:** Refinement of TCP congestion control algorithms.
- **1990s:** Commercialization of the Internet with the rise of ISPs.
- **2000s:** Growth of web applications, stabilization of networks, and convergence with cellular data networks.

## End-to-End Principle

- **Intelligence at End Hosts:** Applications and transport layer functionality (e.g., reliability, security) should reside at the end hosts.
- **Core of the Network:** Should focus on efficient data transportation with minimal processing.

### Evolution of TCP/IP
- **TCP/IP Split:** Initially combined, the TCP and IP layers were later separated to allow flexibility in the transport layer and accommodate different application needs.

## Conclusion

The Internet is a complex, layered system of networks that connects end hosts through routers and switches. It uses IP addressing, encapsulation, and both circuit and packet switching methodologies to ensure reliable and efficient communication. The evolution of protocols and design philosophies such as the end-to-end principle has shaped the modern Internet.
